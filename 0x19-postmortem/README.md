 Postmortem: The Great Database Connection Pool Debacle of 2024

Issue Summary

Duration:  
The outage spanned from June 1, 2024, at 14:00 to June 1, 2024, at 16:30 (UTC). (2 hours and 30 minutes, but who’s counting?)

Impact:  
Our beloved web application took a nap it didn’t wake up from for 2.5 hours. Approximately 85% of users were left staring at error messages, while the other 15% experienced the thrill of watching paint dry as pages loaded at a snail’s pace. User login, data retrieval, and overall experience were as exciting as a Monday morning without coffee.

Root Cause:  
The root cause was a database connection pool set to “tiny” mode. This resulted in our app running out of connections faster than you can say “timeout”.

Timeline

14:00 - 🚨 Monitoring alert: “Houston, we have a problem!” Error rates spiked and response times plummeted.
14:05 - On-call engineer spills coffee, scrambles to logs, and restarts the web server. Spoiler: it didn’t help.
14:15 - Web server still gasping for breath. Assumed it had caught the Monday blues. Restarted again. Nope.
14:30 - Database team summoned like the Avengers. Error logs were hinting at database connection timeouts.
14:45 - Wild goose chase investigating potential network gremlins between web and database servers.
15:00 - 🎯 Bulls-eye! Found the real villain: an exhausted database connection pool.
15:15 - Epiphany! Realized the connection pool was set to handle a tea party, not a rave. Increased the limit.
15:30 - Database services restarted to breathe life back into the connection pool.
15:45 - Web servers restarted with fingers crossed.
16:00 - Service slowly waking up, stretching, and getting back to work. Error rates dropping, response times improving.
16:30 - 🎉 Full service restoration. Monitoring confirms all systems go. Victory dance initiated.






Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause:  
Our database connection pool was set to handle traffic from a few users rather than a stadium full. As user requests skyrocketed, connections got used up, queued, and timed out faster than you can say “bottleneck”.

Resolution:  
We took the following steps:
1. 🕵️‍♂️ Played detective with logs and monitoring tools to pinpoint the issue.
2. 📝 Edited the configuration file to increase the connection pool size.
3. 🔄 Restarted the database service to apply the new settings.
4. 🔄 Restarted the web servers to ensure fresh connections.
5. 👀 Watched the system like a hawk to confirm the fix worked.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements and Fixes:
1. Configuration Management: Regularly review and update configuration settings to handle current and future traffic demands.
2. Monitoring Enhancements: Add advanced monitoring to keep an eye on database connection pool metrics and send alerts before things go south.
3. Scalability Testing: Conduct regular stress tests to ensure our systems can handle peak traffic like a pro.

Tasks:
1. 🛠️ Patch the Database Server: Apply updates for improved performance and stability.
2. 👀 Add Monitoring: Keep tabs on server memory and database connection pool usage.
3. 📝 Review Configuration Files: Give all configuration files a thorough once-over to optimize settings.
4. 🚨 Automated Alerts: Set up alerts for unusual spikes in traffic or database connections to preemptively handle scaling.
5. 📚 Update Documentation: Document steps for handling similar issues to ensure faster resolution in the future.

By implementing these measures, we aim to transform our service into a bulletproof fortress, ready to handle anything thrown its way. 

Here's to a smoother, more resilient future! 🚀
